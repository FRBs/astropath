Abstract:

We introduce a new method to estimate the probability
that an extragalactic transient source 
is associated with a candidate host galaxy.  This approach relies
solely on simple observables: 
sky coordinates and their uncertainties, 
galaxy fluxes and angular sizes.
The formalism invokes Bayes' rule to calculate the
posterior probability P(O_i|x) from the galaxy prior
P(O), observables x, and an assumed 
model for the true distribution
of transients in/around their host galaxies.
Using simulated transients placed in the well-studied 
COSMOS field, we consider several agnostic and 
physically motivated priors and offset distributions
to explore the method sensitivity.
We then apply the methodology to the set of 
13~fast radio bursts (FRBs) localized with an uncertainty of several
arcseconds.  Our methodology finds 
nine of these are securely associated to a
single host galaxy, P(O_i|x)>0.95.
We examine the observed and intrinsic properties of
these secure FRB hosts, 
recovering similar  distributions as previous works.
Furthermore, we find a strong correlation between 
the apparent magnitude of the securely identified 
host galaxies and the estimated cosmic dispersion 
measures of the corresponding FRBs, which results
from the Macquart relation.
Future work with FRBs will leverage this relation and
other measures from the secure hosts as priors for
future associations.
The methodology is generic to transient type,
localization error, and image quality.
We encourage its application to other transients
where host galaxy associations are critical to the
science, e.g. gravitational wave events, 
gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae.
